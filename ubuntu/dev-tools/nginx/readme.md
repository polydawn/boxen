# PD Nginx

A straightforward build of the nginx web server with SSL.

The default configuration serves anything from the `data` folder with a self-signed certificate, removes accidental `www` from URLs, and a sesible starting configuration.

For customizing your own server, extensive [documentation](http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxConfiguration) is available.
