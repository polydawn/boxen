# Largely unmodified ubuntu box.

[default]
	# The image name
	image = "docket.polydawn.net/ubuntu/12.04"

[build]
	# Upstream ubuntu image from graph.
	#
	# This name is used when using the graph as a source, eg:
	# docket run -s graph
	#
	upstream = "index.docker.io/ubuntu/12.04"

	# Upstream ubuntu image pulled from public docker index.
	#
	# As of Docker 0.6.3, the index pull behavior is absolutely insane.
	# I'd love to specify where this image comes from, but I *can't*.
	# Docker explicitly disallows specifying their own URL, see:
	# https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/blob/d30806590c8436941e5c4f2349af61de0128c49e/registry/registry.go#L100
	#
	# Which is why there's an entirely different setting for index. This is passed directly to 'docker pull'.
	# It's assumed that you'll set whatever docker wants to make it happy, then use your own namespace in the graph.
	#
	# As of Docket 0.3.0, Docket prevents accidentally pulling unless you specify index as a source, eg:
	# docket run -s index
	#
	index = "ubuntu:12.04"
