# This is a docket configuration file.
#
# To load configuration, Docket will look in the current directory for a 'docker.toml' file.
# Then it'll keep loading any files in a parent directory, until it finds a folder without one.
#


# Settings control how your containers launch.
# Images in sub-folders will inherit these settings, making it easy to extend configuration.

# All our containers are in sub-folders, so some general settings are all we need.
# Running docket in this folder would fail, since there's no image configured.
